- Version Identifier
- Total Number of fields in device section
- Random hash
- Board name
- Specifies whether the kernel was built in big-endian mode
- Specifies number of global memory systems
For each global memory
  - Total number of fields in each global memory
  - Memory name
  - Memory type
  - Number of memory interfaces (DIMMS or banks) usable as device global memory
 - Total number of fields in each memory interface (DIMM or bank)
  For each memory interface (DIMM or bank)
    - Global memory interface start address
    - Global memory interface end address
  - Memory allocation_type
  - Memory primary interface
  - Size of memory can_access list
  - Global Memory id
- Specifies number of hostpipes
- Total number of fields in each hostpipes 
- Specifies whether the autodiscovery string contains kernel argument information
- Specifies number of device global
- Total number of fields in each device global 
- 0/1 value to indicate if the cra_ring_root exists (1 for true, 0 otherwise)
- Specifies number of pipe mappings
- Total number of fields in each pipe mapping 
- Number of groups of sideband signals -> each group maps to each hostpipe
- Number of kernels
  For each kernel:
   - Number of fields in each kernel
   - Kernel name
   - Start address of kernel control registers
   - Size of kernel control registers
   - Depth of kernel fast relaunch buffer
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-group invariant. If the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to make local_size = global_size. This is an optimization.
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-item invariant. If the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to ensure that only a single thread is present on the device at a time.  This enables a variety of compiler optimizations.
   - Number of times kernel operations are vectorized. The kernel will launched with fewer work-items in each work-groups as many times as the number of vector lanes.
   - number of words in this kernel's profile scan chain.
   - Number of kernel arguments
   For each kernel argument:
    - Number of fields in kernel arguments
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
    - its alignment
    - number of buffer locations
    - internal # representing its type qualifier
    - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel arg is streaming (1 for true, 0 otherwise)
   - Number of printf calls
   - Number of fields in printf calls
   - Number of local memory systems
   - Number of fields in local memory systems
   - X-dim of required work-group size (controlled by __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) )
   - Y-dim of required work-group size
   - Z-dim of required work-group size
   - Number of Maximum work-group size arguments to follow (1, 2 or 3)
   - Scalarized Version of Maximum work-group size
   - Maximum global work dimension (controlled by __attribute__((max_global_work_dim(N))))
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel supports a non-zero global_work_offset argument to clEnqueueNDRangeKernel (controlled by __attribute__((uses_global_work_offset(N))))
   - (1)SYCL compile, else (0)OpenCL compile
   - 0/1 value to indicate if kernel is a streaming kernel
   For each local memory system:
    - ID #
    - function scope local demand
