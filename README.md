# â˜• COFFEE - Compile with OneAPI For FPGA Emulation and Execution

This repository documents my usage of the FOOD repository for my own FPGA and emulation purposes. If you do not require the use of my code, I reccommend a fresh start in the FOOD Repository.

## Usage


## Setup

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomas-dsl-johnson/COFFEE.git
```

**2. Use the FOOD repo to complete setup**
```bash
cd COFFEE
```
Follow instructions in the FOOD README.md or go to the [repository's webpage](https://github.com/thomas-dsl-johnson/FOOD#). 
**IMPORTANT:** Ignore the instruction `cd FOOD` we will be working in the `COFFEE/` directory.
